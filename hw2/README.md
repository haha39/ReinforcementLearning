## According to the rules on Slide 8 of Chapter 4, implement the operation of Grid World. Please provide two answers for this assignment:
1. Based on a random policy, what is the state value of each state when k = 100?
2. Based on the Policy Iteration algorithm from Slide 19 of Chapter 4, and using this algorithm to update the policy for the Grid World:
    + 2.a: Under the optimal policy, what is the action for each state?
    + 2.b: At what value of k is the optimal policy reached?

### Submission format:
The file must include a screenshot of the output showing the state value when the program runs up to k = 100.
